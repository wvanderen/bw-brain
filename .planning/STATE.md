# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-25)

**Core value:** The assistant reliably understands and describes the selected Bitwig context and can only change the project through small, previewable, reversible, daemon-authoritative patches — so it never wrecks the song. Accurate first; creative later.
**Current focus:** Phase 2 — Read-Only Context Foundation (M1)

## Current Position

Phase: 2 — Read-Only Context Foundation (M1)
Plan: 6 plans across 3 waves (planned, verified)
Status: Phase 2 is PLANNED — 6 plans across 3 waves, plan-checker passed after 1 revision (02-03 scope-split into 02-03a trust-spine primitives + 02-03b stateful layer). Wave 1 = {02-01 schemas/enums, 02-02 Java bridge + human-verify}; Wave 2 = {02-03a STATE-04 primitives, 02-04 multicall CLI}; Wave 3 = {02-03b stateful layer + UDS, 02-05 Pi /analyze + human-verify}. All 15 requirements covered, 11/11 decisions covered, Nyquist VALIDATION.md populated. Ready to execute.
Last activity: 2026-06-27 — Phase 2 planned (6 plans, 3 waves, verified)

Progress: [██░░░░░░░░] ~20% — 1/5 phases complete; Phase 2 next

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 5
- Average duration: 17 min
- Total execution time: ~0.6 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1. Schema & IPC Spike | 3/3 | ~38 min | 13 min |
| 2. Read-Only Context Foundation (M1) | 0/TBD | — | — |
| 3. Reversible MIDI Patching (M2) | 0/TBD | — | — |
| 4. Arrangement Intelligence (M3) | 0/TBD | — | — |
| 5. Automation & Device Workflows (M4) | 0/TBD | — | — |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: 1-01 (19 min), 1-02 (15 min), 1-03 (4 min autonomous + manual checkpoints)
- Trend: steady; daemon-side framing pipe landed cleanly on the Plan-01 contract; live round-trip confirmed

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 5-phase vertical-slice structure (de-risk spike → M1 → M2 → M3 → M4) honoring accurate-first sequencing; large M1/M2 phases kept as single vertical slices (decomposed into plans rather than split into horizontal layers).
- [Roadmap]: Phase 1 leads with PROBE-01 + PROBE-02 — the single highest-risk structural unknown (Bitwig TCP) gates all bridge work.
- [Roadmap]: UX-06 (assumptions[] field) placed in Phase 2 as a foundational guardrail established from M1.
- [Phase 1 / Plan 01]: Frozen protocol breadth = envelope spine + version handshake + 4 seed-example message shapes (selection.changed, get.selected_clip, {id,ok,payload} response, apply.patch); speculative catalog marked Phase 2-extensible per Pitfall 4. Calibrated against SC#3.
- [Phase 1 / Plan 01]: Trust-spine enforced at schema level — edit.schema.json requires payload.undoLabel (minLength 1) + payload.operations (minItems 1); the bridge can refuse unlabeled edits by validation alone. PROJECT.md guardrail + AGENTS.md line 17.
- [Phase 1 / Plan 01]: Codegen via scripts/gen-types.mjs ($id-aware bundler) instead of the literal json2ts CLI — @apidevtools/json-schema-ref-parser cannot resolve cross-file $refs against the absolute https $id scheme and json2ts compiles each file independently. Contract schemas stay pristine; runtime Ajv resolves $ref by $id natively.
- [Phase 1 / Plan 02] Transport interface is the D-05 spine: the reader consumes ONLY Transport.onMessage/send/close, never net.Socket — TcpServerTransport (loopback) + StdioTransport (fallback) make the kept framing reusable regardless of the Transport Decision Rule outcome.
- [Phase 1 / Plan 02] Loopback bind is constructor-enforced (Pitfall 5): TcpServerTransport throws on any host !== 127.0.0.1 AND always passes the host arg to listen — the all-interfaces wildcard is unreachable. lsof confirms 127.0.0.1-only.
- [Phase 1 / Plan 02] Ajv 2020-12 envelope validator compiled ONCE at module load (standalone-compiled, AGENTS.md 64-65); reader enforces explicit backpressure (Pattern 5): observational events drop-oldest + dropped notice, edits/requests never drop.
- [Phase 1 / Plan 02] Under NodeNext, Ajv 2020-12 must be imported as named { Ajv2020 } from ajv/dist/2020.js (ajv 8.20 ships no exports map; .js ext required). addFormats dropped — no frozen schema uses the format keyword (premise false), and its CJS default-export interop is not callable as a static NodeNext import.
- [Phase 1 / Plan 03] Only Task 1 is autonomous; Tasks 2 (in-app capability probes → docs/bitwig-capabilities.md Observed: fields) and 3 (transport proof + live SC#1 round-trip) are blocking human-verify checkpoints. Observed Bitwig behavior is the spike's OUTPUT (D-02) — never fabricated. Skeleton + throwaway artifacts (spike/bitwig-extension.js + spike/raw-tcp-probe.java + capabilities-doc skeleton) committed as b14a52d; the manual work is documented precisely in 01-03-SUMMARY.md → "Manual Steps Remaining."
- [Phase 1 / Plan 03] Decoupled tracks (RESEARCH.md §The JS-vs-Java Spike Tension): Track A (capability probes via JS — D-07 iteration speed) is in spike/bitwig-extension.js; Track B (transport proof via raw java.net OR the OSC-as-proof fallback) is in spike/raw-tcp-probe.java. SC#1 is never hostage to whether JsApi exposes networking — Track B can use DrivenByMoss's proven OSC server as a stand-in if JDK 21 is not installed.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- *(Phase 1 blockers all resolved — spike goal achieved.)* Bitwig loopback TCP access: CONFIRMED live (Java `.bwextension`, captured `selection.changed` round-trip). JDK 21: installed via Homebrew. In-app scripting guide / Javadoc 6.0.6: consulted; capability surface recorded in `docs/bitwig-capabilities.md`. JS-vs-Java tension: resolved — JS `host` has no networking, Java `.bwextension` is the mandatory transport.
- [Phase 2 — to watch]: no native stable-IDs in Bitwig → Phase 2 must implement STATE-04 fingerprint-mapping. Behavioral probes (undo-coalescing, live NoteStep round-trip, automation envelope) deferred to pre-Phase-3; non-blocking for Phase 2 planning but run them before Phase 3.
