# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-25)

**Core value:** The assistant reliably understands and describes the selected Bitwig context and can only change the project through small, previewable, reversible, daemon-authoritative patches — so it never wrecks the song. Accurate first; creative later.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Schema & IPC Spike (de-risk Bitwig TCP + freeze the JSON-Lines contract)

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 (Schema & IPC Spike)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-06-26 — Roadmap created (5 phases derived from 42 v1 requirements; 100% coverage)

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 5-phase vertical-slice structure (de-risk spike → M1 → M2 → M3 → M4) honoring accurate-first sequencing; large M1/M2 phases kept as single vertical slices (decomposed into plans rather than split into horizontal layers).
- [Roadmap]: Phase 1 leads with PROBE-01 + PROBE-02 — the single highest-risk structural unknown (Bitwig TCP) gates all bridge work.
- [Roadmap]: UX-06 (assumptions[] field) placed in Phase 2 as a foundational guardrail established from M1.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 1]: Bitwig TCP socket access is MEDIUM confidence — must be confirmed before daemon-as-TCP-server commits; stdio-relay fallback ready.
- [Phase 1]: In-app scripting guide is the authoritative API reference and has never been fetched (web searches 404-prone) — must be opened in-app during the spike; record in `docs/bitwig-capabilities.md`.
